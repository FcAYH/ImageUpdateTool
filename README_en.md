# ImageUpdateTool

> [简体中文版本](README.md)

This is a tool to maintain the Github image bed. Just like PicGo (but the function is definitely not as powerful as PicGo).

Usage:

1. You need to install git before using this software. Make sure to add the path of git to the system environment variables;
2. When you first open it, you will automatically enter the Settings interface. Please configure the information in this interface and click `Apply`;

3. Click the `Upload Image` button, you can select the image you want to upload. After a successful upload, click the `Copy URL` button to copy the link of the most recently uploaded image.

Note:

The basic functions of this software are just in a state that can be used :joy:

1. Since accessing Github in China is quite mysterious (sometimes it can be accessed, sometimes it can't), git push/clone operations may fail due to network reasons. When git operations fail due to network reasons, you can wait a while and click Retry. If you hang a ladder for git, there will be basically no failure.
